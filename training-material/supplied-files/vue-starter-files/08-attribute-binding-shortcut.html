    Many attributes, including v-bind, have a shortcut syntax. Note that some of these shortcut syntaxes (or some variants of these shortcuts) cannot be used in DOM template versions (there is no restriction in the string template version though).

    Step 1: Copy the previous file, and use the shortcut version of v-bind:attr="variable" which is :attr="variable"
