<!--
    Computed properties are variables whose valued are derived from state (data). They are defined as functions but used as normal properties when binding in the template. They return the computed value. When the data accessed within the function body changes, the function runs and they are re-computed.

    Step 1: Copy the previous file. Add a data - "subject" with some name (say "world"). The method changes the subject now.
    Step 2: Add a "computed" section with a "greeting" property. It is a function that returns the computed value (say, "Hello world"). Observe that when the subject changes (say it becomes "Vue"), the greeting should become "Hello Vue".
