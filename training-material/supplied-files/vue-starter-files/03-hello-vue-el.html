    $moount() is useful if you want to delay the mounting of the Vue app. If the DOM where Vue is to render the app is ready, we can pass the "el" property to the Vue instance and avoid calling $mount.  
    
    Step 1: Take a copy of the previous file. Use "el" property (passing the selector to the app node) instead of calling $mount()
