    Props for components can be bound in the same way as native HTML elements (using v-bind:attr or its shorthand :attr)

    Step 1: Copy the previous file. Define this as a global variables and set "data" in the root instance to this array.
    const weatherReportData = [
        {
            city : "San Jose",
            min : 15,
            max : 30,
            rainfall : 12,
            lastFiveDaysRainfall : [ 20, 15, 10, 5, 0 ],
            theme: 'primary'
        },
        {
            city : "San Francisco",
            min : 7,
            max : 21,
            rainfall : 15,
            lastFiveDaysRainfall : [ 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 ],
            theme: 'secondary'
        }
    ];

    Step 2: Use v-bind:attr or its shorthand :attr to pass data to the 2 instances of WeatherReport.
